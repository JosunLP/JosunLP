### WAPS-Framework
A PHP web app framework. It's designed to make small future projects faster and easier. The focus is on PHP backend systems and thanks to its modularity it supports a wide range of projects. This entire framework has emerged as a learning project and is being developed continuously.

The WebApp PHP Sample Framework, or WAPS Framework for short, originated from the intention to understand solid, self-written backend. Started as a learning project, it is constantly developing into a solid, completely open source PHP framework that can serve a wide variety of areas.
